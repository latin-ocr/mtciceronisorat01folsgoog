mim into the Picene territory, and C. Julius into Apulia.

10. Huic ipsi Jom· Statori.- The temple in the Capitol was conse·
crated to Jupiter Stator, Juno, and Minerva ; the cell of Jupiter was
in the middle, of Minerva on the right, and ns Juno on the lest. lt
was founded, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, by Tarquinius
Priscus on this occasion. In a severe battle, which that king fou ht
against the Sabines, his enemies at first were victorious; but, ar-
quin having vowed a temple to the deities abovementioned, if they
would turn the tide of success, the hopes of their assistance excited

fresh courage in the soldiers, and he by· this means gained the vic· ,

ear of Rome, rebuilt by Sulla, and dedicated by Quintus Catulus.
fn the part devoted to Jupiter, Cicero was now speaking to the
senate, and his happy allusion to the cause of the building of the
temple made a strong impression upon the minds of the senators. It
was dedicated to Jupiter Stator, which appellation was given him,
because he stayed the victorious pursuit of the Sabines, and saved
the Romans from defeat, and perhaps from destruction. Rome, by
the providential discovery of Catiline's conspiracy, was lately de.
livered from ruin equally imminent3 and Cicero, no less grateful for
his remarkable deliverance than Tarquin, gave great thanks to the

immor-tal gods, and with great propriety to Juplter Stator in par- ·

ticular, the most anclent protector of the city, who had delivered ir
from early destruction, and had so latel preserved it from conflagra-
tion, and prevented the assassination o its senate and citizens. ’

13. In uno homino: This sentence alludes to Catiline’s former at·
tem ts to raise himself to sovereign power.

If. Con-suli designato .· During the interval between the electior:
of consuls and their entrance into office, which was generally six
months, the persons chosen were called consuls doct. Cicero and
Catiline the last year had been rival candidates, and as Cicero suc-
ceeded not only in being elected to the consulship himself, but also
in excluding Catiline, this assassin had determined to attempt to

murder him in the Campus Martius. The vigilance os Cicero, ,

however, defeated his design. The next year, while Cicero was
consul, 'at the time the Comitia were held, he ‘n employed his
influence in reventing the election of Catiline, teg? stood candidate
for the consu ship this year also, and Catiline again endeavored to
kill him in the field of election. But the prudence os Cicero and the
exertions of his friends again prevented the execution of his mur-
derous intentions. See Introduction, . 165.

35. Non jubeo: He only advises, he does-not order, because to ”

command hun to leave the city would have been to assume too much
