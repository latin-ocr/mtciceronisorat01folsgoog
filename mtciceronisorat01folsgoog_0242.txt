INTRODUCTION.

Tus most remarkable event which happened in the close of the

, year of Rome 691, says Dr. Middleton‚ ‘⁴ was the pollution of the

blow towards the ruin of the republic. Clodius was now quaestor,
and, by that means, a senator; descended from the noblest family in

. Rome‚in the vigor of his a , of a graceful person, lively wit, and

flowing eloquence: but, wit all the advantages of nature, he had a

to the great amazement of the matrone, who presen y threw a veil

over the sacred myster-ies, while Clodius found means to escape by
the favor of some of the damsels.”

These facts seing publioly known, clodius vm cauea to a trial,
