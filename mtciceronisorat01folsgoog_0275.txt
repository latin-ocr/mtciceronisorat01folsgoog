Μ. ANTONY.

35 Pfoygtum : Aster the defeat at Pharsalia, Pompey fled to Paphos,
a cit 0 rus.

4. yHoereAEZm mihi negasti venire .- It was common among the Ro·
mans to -be ueath legacies to distinguished men, and it was a reproach
to a man o talenta to have no legacy bequeathed him. In reply to
this sarcasm of Antony, Cicero said, he wished that what Anton
sajd was true, as, in that case, many of his friends, who were dea ,
would be living3 and then he asserta, that he had received by lega
cies more than 3160,oe0.

6. HS ducenties : H may be considered as 11 (i. e. duo) merely
crossed by a horizonta] line; since HVIR, for nuuuvm, is found on

ancient coins, and the numeral X is frequently so crossed (Ξ) . S

stands for semis, half. Thus HS (⁴⁴ two and a half” are used as a
ffifftzissffi‘ss‘sstsssssssffl 3¹23&ssssssss ῗῗῧηὲι mssussi’tfffffffl’
eording to the ancient custom, in reckoning money, of lacing a
fraction before a‚whole number ιο diminish the latter. gimnas- is
the Greek idiom ἥμισυ τρίτον, “ two and a half.” Sestertius is rop-
erly an adjective agreeing with nummus, understood, which, ow-
ever, is sometimes* expressed (sestertius nummus), and is sometimes
. even used alone in this sense, having sestertius understood before
it. The sestertius (nummus was ori ‘nally one quarter (23 asses)
of the denarius or piece of l asses. n com uting by the sestertius,
when the number amounted to one or more thousands, the Romans
commonly put the word in ,the genitive plural (sestertiorum, or, con-
tracted, sestertium) governed by mille, bis miile or bina millia, octo
miztia, centena millia, bis centena millia, δια, signifying so many
thousands, or hundreda of thousands, of sestertii (nummi) 3 but when
the number amounted to decies centena millia sestertium, ⁴⁴ ten hun·-
dred thousand '' or a ⁴⁴ million sestertii,” the words centena millia were
by custom suppressed, leaving decies sestertium, to signify ⁴⁴ a million
sestertii.'‘ But we find expressions like summa· decies sestertii, and
vivere in decies sestertio, meaning also ⁴⁴ a million sestertii,” and the
{ffiffgffluffisse ffioessffiiossm “fisszut‘i‘ssvfz‘zai’yffingffffssffizi
have adopted the opinion, that decies, in the reckoning of sestertii,
came to be considered as an indeclinable substantive noun, in the
singular number, and sestertium as an adjective, agreeing with it in
number and gendei, and varying in case as the position of decies in
the sentence might require. Tlus 0 inion is supported by the phrases,
Iwc decies, decies plenum, and the li e. The same is true of the nu-
meral adverbs higher than decies. According to this explanation,
HS ducenties in the text is sestertio ducenties, in the ablative, gov-
erned by amplius, and is equivalent to ducenties centena millia ses-
tertium, ⁴⁴ two‘hundred hundred thousand ” or ⁴⁴ twenty million ses-
tertii.'’ See also page 141, line 25, where sestertium sm ' is in
the accusative, governed by peteret, and signifies 6‚000‚ . On

legacies only gy the willspf his friends; that Anton‘y succeeded to

both friends an enemies, and defraudin their heirs.
