M. macrinum. 217

Pompey’s party had succeeded, victory and it· consequenm would ὕ
have been more bloody. .
5. Alterius....partis: The arty of Pom y and the senate. 66
l15. Ezcdlentc bono .- By these words icero means Coesar’s great
c emeno .

28. offiniono.2..stulta fortasse: It would have been better to omit
the word stulta. Caesar might have been raised for his clemenoy
without hearing the republican opinions of his antagonist degrada}
by the appellation offo ty.

32. Querelam....suspioeonom.· Caesar, as has been before mention·
ed, suspected that Marcellus still harbored evil designs against him.

· 18. Omnia, eta: Cicero here advises Caesar to restore the repub- 67
lic, and correct the abuses of its eonstitution; and such was his ad-
dress, that the advice was not displeasing to the despot; but it was
improbable that an usurpet. so ambitious of power as was Ceasar,
should observe counsels so contrary ιο the 'desi ns for the comple-
tion of which he had fought and slain above a mi ion of men. .

30. Jtmm....v0oem....satis diu....via:i.· Aster having complained of
the animosity of Marcellus, Coesar said, that he himself had lived
long enough for either nature or glory. At this time he was in tho

fist ·fourth year of his age.
’ d &a Doctorum hominum .· The Stolos, who pretended to despiss

eat .
36. Crebra dicere .· Suetonius relates, that Caesar had in reality
’ven some of his friends reason ιο believe, that he did not wish to

ffve longer, and that he did not regret the ill statem· his health.

7. Vide, quoeso, ne tua divina virtus, etc„- Cicero here deserves ὦ
credit for his address, and the freedom of his cantion.

27. Nunc, etiam quoe laudet, exspectat .· The free-dom of this remark
also is to be commended. Coesar was, without doubt, a man of great
abilities; posterity will long admira his talents; but, as Cicero tells
him, it ought to see something it can commend as well as admire.
'Insatiable ambition and goodness are seldom companions.

«28. Imperia, provincias, etc. .· ,Caesar had commanded an army in
Gaul, Britain, Germany and Africa. Spain, after his pretorship,
and Gaul aster his consulshi ‚ were the provinces assigned ιο him.
He first built a brid e over the Rhine, over which he passed his army,
and conquered the germans. 0 He first commanded a fleet in the At-
lantic ocean, b which he carried his army into Great Britain. He
conquered Ptolemy kin of Egypt, a country annual] overflowed
by the river Nile. hor t e number of his battles, see ote, page (53,
line 20. Monuments and statues were erected to lum aster his civ·
il wars, and honors were paid to him ‘as to a god. As was usual
after victories, he had given many presente to his soldiers, and had
also entertained the people with feasts, theatrical exhibitions, διο.
He had trium hed five times. ‘⁴ But, notwithstanding all these
things,” says icer0, who appears in this part of the oration with
that ⁴dignity which he always should have possessed when addressing
Coesar‚ ‘⁴ notwithstanding all these, your fame may be spread throug
the world, but it will never be stable, unless you strengthen this city
by your counsels, and guard it by your laws. ' For this passage, and
the succeeding remarks, Cicero deserves great credit. ο.

immortality of the sou . ⁶

7. Vicit is, qui, etc. .- The moderatiori and clemency of Coesar ap· ω

pem-ed greater from contrsst, as Pompey, who, during the civil· war,
