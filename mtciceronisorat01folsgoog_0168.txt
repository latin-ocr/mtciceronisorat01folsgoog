of bribery and corruption by the Calpurnisn Law, and being brought
ιο trial, and found guilty before their entrance into office, their ar·
cusers and competitore, L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius‘
Cotta, were proclaimed consuls elect. Some little time aster this,
Catiline, who, on the expiration os his proetorshi , had obtained the

revince of Africa, came to Rome to sue for consulship; but,
{cing accused of extortion and rapine in that government, was not
permitted to pursue his pretendens. ’

At this time, Cn. Piso, a young nobleman, extremely bold, indi-
gent, end factious, was instigated, by his poverty and depraved
morsls, to raise disturbances in the-state ; with him Catiline and
Autronius entered into a combInation about the fifth of December to
assassinate the consuls Torquatus and Cotta, in th‘e Capitol, on the
first of January; which done, Autronius and Catiline were to seize
the consuls ' and send Piso with an army to take possession of
both Spains. ut, their object somehow getting air, they deferred
the intended assassination to the 5th of February ; at which time they

Not long aster this disappointment, Catiline was brought to trial
for his o pressions in Africa. Of his guilt nobody doubted5 but,
throu h the iniquity of his jud s, he was acquitted. . -

An} the very next year( ), when Cicero was a candldate³ ιιι

him for the same dignity. But the rumor of a dreadsul plot, read

to break out, produced a disposition universally to confer the con a

ship on Cicero, whose abilities were well known. This plot was

the famous conspiracy of Catiline. · · · ⁷
Sallust, after relating the universal prevalence, at Rome, of those
vices that are the ruin of states, rapacious covetousness, shameless
venality‚ and boundless luxury, adds, that Catiline had collected,
which m such a city it was not difficult to do, a band of needy prof-
· ligatas, who attended him as guards to his person; that‘he had
been very assiduous in seekin intimacies with young persons chiefly,
whose minds, being sost anf pliable, were easily moulded to what
