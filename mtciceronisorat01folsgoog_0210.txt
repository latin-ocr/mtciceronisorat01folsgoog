Jason and the Argonauta in acquiring the Golden Fleece, ed with

him and fearing AEetes, her father, would over-take her, cut ber

brother Absyrtus in pieoes, and strewed them in the way to chech

the ursuit. In a similar manner, Mithridates, as Cicero says, scat-

{ref his treasures before the army of Lucullus, and was thus enabled

49 6. Ρῖιῗνω diam gantas .- The army of Tigranes was composed of
Armenians, Gordyaenians, Medes, Adiabemaus, led by their kings;
Arabians from the country between Bab lon and the Persian gulf;
Albanians and iberians from the coasts ο the Caspian sea3 and seve·
ral free natione and Nomades (Tartars) from the ne‘ hborhood of the
Araxes. The forces of Tigranes consisted ol' 20, archers and
alingers 3 55,000 horse, moon of which might be said to be cased in
iron ; 150‚000 infantry, and 35‚000 pioneers and other laborers. The
Roman army, however, not a twentieth part of the number of the
troops of the king of Armenia, conquered them, and took his capital,

1. Pam· locupletissimi .- Cieero refers to a famous temple of Bel·
lona, at Comana, which was plundered by Murena, Sulla‘s lieutenant.

15. Nimia longinquitate locorum .· Asser the taking of Ti ranocerta,
Lucullus intended to continue his march to Artaxata, the {umet cap·
ital of Armenia, but, as it was distant many days’ march to the north,
and as the winter was advancing, with snowy and tempestuous
westher, the soldiers, fatigued by the severities of the campa' ,
refused ιο follow him. The mutiny in the army of Lucullusffi·
been attributed to his pride and avarice; but, though those faults of
the general may have produced bad consequences, the real cause of
the sedition was the intrigues of the disappointed and infamous
mig-¹ ¹151.st jam {ium nem dicam .· As the dis ute concerning the merit

and enemies, Cicero very prudently avoids offending either party.

rash lieutenant‚ Triarius. ’

caused this calamity. Flattered by the prospect of the glory he

· should acquire b conquerin in the absence of his general, he fought
with the king o Pontus, an was so totally dest-ate ‚ that not one of
his army would have escaped, had not Mithridates received a wound,
which induced his generals ιο check the pur-suit. This was the most
severe defeat which the Romans experienced in all their wars against
Mithridates; seven thousand Romans remained dead upon the field
of battle. ‘⁴ Cicero,” says a celebrated Roman historiam, ⁴⁸ was in·
duced to say, that the Roman general received only from public ru-
mor the news of Triarius's defeat, not from a regard to truth, but
‚that he might flatter Pompey at the effpense of Lucullus.’'
