THE Pom· ARCHIAS. 229

THE ‘ORATION FOR THE Pom* ARCHIAS.

 

INTRODUG'I'ION.

Tms elegant oration was delivered in the 692nd year of Rome, two
years aster the consulship of Cicero, and one year after the defeat of
Catiline and his accomplices. In early life Cicero had been placed
nider the tuition of Aulus Lucinius Archias, a native of Antioch,
and a man patronized by men of the greatest emine-nce in Rome for
his learning, genius, and oliteness. His celebrity was so great,
that Lucullus invited him reside in his family, and g'ave him the
privilege of opening a school in it, to which many of ·the young Ro-
man nobility were sent to be educated. The prosperity of this popu-
lar poet and instructor, howev'er, was interrupted by the malignity
of an obscure person, of the name of Gracchus, or by the subornationi
of those who persuaded him to acts of enmity against Archias. Syl·
vanus and Carbo had passed, a law, which enacted, that those should
be esteemed Roman citizens, who were admitted to the freedom of
&dfifaihss ἓίἶῗῗξῖέῗῖἓιὲῗῗῃῖὴᾝέ Ἓιῗιῑὲῒὲ ἳιῖἐῗερὲιῗξῗὲξ ἓξεὲῗὲ
the τοῖσι· wit-hin sixty days. Upon this law, in the consulship of
M ἓ. Piso and M. V. Messala, Gracchus accused Archiss; heUsaid
that Archias lived in the city as a citizen, while he was not entitled
to the rights of citizenship: He denied that Archias was admitted
to the freedom of any of the confederated cities‚ that he’ had an abode
in Italy, at the time the law was passed, and that he had claimed the
privileges of a citizen before the praetor. In this oration, which was
delivered before the pretor, Cicero defends Archias, his friend and
former instructori he refutes the alle tions of Gracchus, and proves
that Archias was admitted to the reedom of Heraclea and other
, cities, that he dwelt in Italy at the time of the passing of the law,

and that he claimed his rivile s before the praetor. ‘The orator,
however, does not confine ‘ sel to the defence of Archias, but, with
great beaut and elegance, descants upon the raises of poetry in
general, an upon the talenta ind merit of the de endant. According
to Dr. Middleton, Cicero “ expected for ,his pains an immortality ot
fame from the praises of Archias’s muse3 but, by a contrary fate of
things, instead of deriving any addition of lory from Archias’s com-
positione, it is wholly owin to his own, at the name of Archias

as not long ago been burie in oblivion. From the great character
given by him of the talenta and genius of this poet, we cannot help
regretting the entire loss of his works ; he had sung, in Gre’ek verse,

the triumphs of* Marius over the Cimbri, and of Lucullus over Mithri· ·

dates, and ‘was now attempting the consulship of Cicero; but this
rished with the rest, or, rather, was left unfimshed, and intel-rupted
y his death, since we find no further mention of it in Cicero’s later

writings.” At the time of delivering this oration, Cicero was in the
scay-suth year of his age. ⁶
