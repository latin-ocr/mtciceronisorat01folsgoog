Tnx Second Edition of this book having been revised by the Editor
of the present, in the year 1811, under the direction and with the assiste·
ance of the respected head of the institution for the use of which it
was originally prepared, and having obtained the reputation' of an ac·
curate classica} school-book, it was with regret that those who felt a
personal concern in that edition, saw a third and surreptitious one make
its appearance, deformed with the grossest errore, and, by the absence of
all intelligent care, doing discredit to the classical school with the name
of which it was associated.

At the instance, therefore, of 'his venerated friend, Dr. Abbot, the ι

Editor under-took to publish a Fourth Edition, which should be less un·
, worthy of the Roman orator, and of that seat of liberal discipline, so
fondly remembered ‘by so many of the friends of good learning in the
communit .

As to tlyie Text, that of the edition of Cicero’s works by Dr. Cal-ey
(among what are commoniy called the Rogom's Pocka Classica), which
is derived from olivet and Ernesti, has been adopted, as by far the best

modern criticism upon this author3 but for the distribution into para-
graphs, the punctuation, and, in general, the judicious employment of

⁷ the resources of the printing art to illustrate the sense, is probably un·

equalled. The words included in brackets are such ao are considered
to be spurious, or are rendered doubtful by being variously written in ,
different MSS„ or for some other reason are a subject of ‹ii-agreement
= among critics. No change has been made in this text, except in con-
sor-ming the orthography of certain words to that of the dictionaries and
grammars in common use in this country, and distinguishing by accentu
certain equivocal words. The lines have been numbered in theflmargin,
as well for the sake of disencumbering the body of the text of figures re-
ferring to the notes, as for the convenience of the instructer in exercising
his pupils' ιιι grammatical analysi's.

The Notes, according to the good usage which now prevails in0books of ’
“ this sort, have been placed by themselves at the end of the volume, that
they may be consulted only when needed, ιιι learning a Iesson, and not
when the pupil should rely on his memory, in rociting it. Seme of the
explanatory notes were rendered unnecessary by the improved state of
the text, and these have been omitted3 some that were wrong have
