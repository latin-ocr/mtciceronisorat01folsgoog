was his colleague in ἑο consulship, at first imagined himself in
danger, and began ιο fortify his house3 but, observing the indecis-
ion and pacific conduct os the authors of Caesar’s death, he recover-
ed his spirits, and resolved to usurp the govemment as soon as he
was able, and, on pretence of avenging the murder of his colleague,

proof of his sincerity, moved, that the conspirators should be invited
to take part in the public deliberatione, and sent his son as a hostage
for their safety. The invitation was accepted3 Brutus supped with

. Lepidus, Cassius with Antony3 the day was closed with joy and re-

joicing, and the city thought that liberty would be secured with

peace. On pretence of pu lic concord, however, Antony proposed

that no good was ιο be expected from him, or a senate 'which was
