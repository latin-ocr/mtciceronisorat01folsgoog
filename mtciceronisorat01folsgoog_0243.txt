truth obliged him to testify, Clodius from that time became his im-
· placable enemy. He not only procured the banishment of Cicero,
but extended his resentment to deeds of malice against the friends
of the orator. Os these friends Milo was one, and consequently
was osten persecuted by Clodius. lt afterwards happened, in the
'701st ear of Rome, when Milo, with two powerful competitore, was

The senate and all the virtuous art of the community were in fa-

election of consuls for a long time aster its usual period.

of the Calends of February, Milo went to Lanuvium (of which he
was a citizen, and, at that time, dictator) in order to create a priest
on the next day; and that Clodius, in his return from Aricia, met
him, about three in the asternoon, a little on the other side of Βουίἱῖω,
and nigh the place where* the temple of Bona Dea stood. Clodius
was on horseback3 his retinue consisted of about thirty slaves with
swords, and every way prepared for an attack, which was· the usual
way of travelling in those days. Besides these, Clodius had three
companions‚ one a Roman knight, named C. Cassinius Scola, the
other tw0, P. Pomponius and Caius Clodius, raised. from the plebeian ·
to the equestrian order. Milo was in a chariot together with his
wife Fausta, and Marcus Fusius, his intimate acquaintance. He was
attended by a great number of servants, some of them gladiatore,
and two of them, Eudamus and Birria, famous in their profession3
who, walking slowl in the rear, happened to enter into a quarrel
with the servants o Clodius. As Clodius turned about, with a stern
and menacing air, to behold the fray, Birria run him through the
shoulder with a sword. The riot increasing, Milo's servants ran up
to the assistance of their companionS, and Clodius, bein wounded,
was carried into a tavern near Bovium. Milo, hearing at Clodius
was wounded, and ⁴thinkin that it might prove dangerous, if he
should live to resen't⁴ it, but tffat his death would-give him reat satis-
faction, even though he should be punished for lt, ordere the tav-
ern to be broken open. Marcus Fustenus was the leader of Milo's
servants, and Clodius, attemptin to conceal himself, was dra ged
forth, and killed with repeated sta s. His body was lest on theffi
way, because his servants were either slain, or, being wounded, took
care to conceal themselves. Sextus Tedius, a senator, as he hap-
pened to return from the countr , took it up, and ordered it to be
carried to Rome. The body reac ed Rome before the first hour of ”
the night; a great multitude of servants and of the lower class of
people ssocked about it, and mourned over it, when lyin in the
court 'before the house. What heightened the horror of e deed,
