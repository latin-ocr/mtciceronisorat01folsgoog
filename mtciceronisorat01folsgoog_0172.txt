Αι the consqu election, which came on presently aster this, Cicero,
aprehending there would be an attem t to assassinate him in the

ield of ΜΨ, took care to throw back ’s gown, and let the people
see a sinning- breast-plate, which he wore under 1t; a precaution
which, deeply im rinting on the multitude a sense of the common
danger, revente , as he told Casilino asterwards to his face, his

Cadini-130, thus a second time repulsed, and breathing nothing but
rerenge, was now eager and impatient to execute his grand plot.
With this yiew he despatched C. Manlius, ‘then at Rome, to Fesulae,
and the ad acent- parts of ‘Etr-una ; Septimius-to the territory of Pice·

received intelligence from Crassus, who, with M. Marcellus and Me·
tellus Scipio, came ιο his house at midnight‚ and, having· caused him·
ιο be waked, put into his hand a paquet of letters, which had been
lest with Crassus‘s porter by a person unknown. Among these let-
ters was one directed ιο Crassus himself, but without the name of
the writer; the rest were directed to other senators. Crassus opened
his own, and finding in it an exhortation to him to quit Rome,because
Catiline was ‘soon to make at havoc there, he immediately carried
all the letters to the co ς who thereupon convened the senate
and delivered them, each according· to its ‘direction. Being read aloud
to the assembly‚ they were found to contain advices of the same im-

consuls ‘⁴ to take care that the republic ‘received no detriment.” Cat-
