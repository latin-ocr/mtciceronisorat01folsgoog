43 18. Caute integreque.- Cincius, a Tribune, m the yearof the city
5⁴9, passed a law, that no one should take money,or a, presenttbr

Pleffl. yar!¹² γοῆιαυῗὲρήωιωε Comitia for electing ' tes and enact-
inffihm were often dissolved by some person's . ' the auspices,
w ch deferred the meetmg to another day. Tlns was an expedient

osten used by those public officere} who were opposed to a successfiil
candidate or a popular law, to prevent the passing of the one or the
election' os the other. In the year in which Cicero offered himself
candidate for the praetorship, by the ²promul tion of several laws, to
which the senate were much oppose , the omitia were so osten dis-
solved, it was feared there would be no election. ,These disturb-
ances, however² were the occasion of an unexpected honor to Cicero,
in the three different assemblies convened for the choice of raetors,
two of which were dissolved without effect, he was declare every
time the first prator by the suffrages os all the centuries.—Cemnriis
cunctis.- The praetors were chosen by the Cornia‘a centuriata, as were
also the consuls and censors3 inferior magistrates were chosen by the
Comitia tributa.- in the last-mentioned assemblies, the majority of the
votes in each tribe determined the general vote of the tribe, and a
majority os tribes determined the election, in which the meanest citi·
zen, therefore, had as much influence as the most powerful3 but in
the Comitia veritur-iata, instituted by ' Servius Tullius, the balance
df the power was put into the hands the affluent and noble. All
the citizens were dwided into 193 centuries, according to a valua·
tion of their estates, and these centuries were, according to the same
mle, reduced into six classes3 the first and richest class consisted of

ninety-seven centuries, a majorit of the whole number. If, theress ,

fore, the centur-ies of the first c ass agreed, the affair was decided;
th tes of the rest were of little importance.

44 7. ultr-idme et Tigrane .· Mithridates is considered by Plutarch
(imbuendo) as a king, in int of talenta, second only to Alexander
the Great. He had expel ed Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, and Ario-
barzanes, king of Cappadocia, from their res ctive kin doms; and,
by the extent of his territories and the num rof his liances, be-
came one of the most werful enemies ever opposed to Rome. At
the beginning of the ithridatic war, in which Tigranes also, '
of Armenia, became involved, that prince was the most powe ·

sovereign in Asia. He reduced the Parthians, subdued Mesopotamia, · ’

obl d.the Arabians, called Scenitae, to quit their deserts, and ruled
thelffingdom of S ’ae-Alter relictus: A mutiny in the army of Lu·
cullus prevented at neral from making use of the advantagdffhe
had ac uired over Mit ridates.

7. A er ἰαοωείτωε Mithridates, being repeatedl defeated b Lu· ·

cullus, retired to the court of Tigranes, his son-in· aw. The ⁴ man
general demanded him of that king, and threatened war in case of
refusal. Tigranes refused, and soon aster was defeated and dispos-
sessed of his capital, Tigranocerta. Provoked by his loss, he made
’ ,at exertions to retrieve his affairs, and, in consequence of the un·
ortunate sedition in the Roman camp, and of the recall of Lucullus,
ravaged Cappadocia, and was carrying his depredations into other
revinces. ·
p 9. equitibus Romanis.- The Roman revenues were farmed by the.
, knights, who were divided into several societies for this purpose. ln
Rom-e these farmers of the revenue were in much respect, but in the
¹ provinces they were osten deservedly detested.
