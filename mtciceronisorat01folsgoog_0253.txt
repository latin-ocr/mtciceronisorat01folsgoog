T. A. MILO. 247

of the senate, because'the murder of Clodius was committed in self- 102
defence‚ to which every man had a natural right.

4. Ambusti tribuni plebis .- The epithet ambusti was applied to Mu· 103 ι

natius Plancus, because he instigated and assisted the people to burn
the court, and the desks, seats, tables, and books in the* F orum.-In

· ter-‘morture conciones .· These short-lived harangues, by asserting that

the senate was under the control of Cicero, implied, that the , senate
‚decre-ed nothing against Milo; which contradiction to the assertions
of the other enemies of Milo, Cicero here notices.

13. Hanc questionem .· ‘⁴ This entraordinary trial.'’

17. Incesta stupro: The word incestus was used ογ the Romans in
relation not only to a kinswoman, but also to a vestal virgin, or any
female immediatel employed in performing the rites a'nd ceremo-
nies· of religion. l't is therefore properly applied to Clodius in rela-
tion to Caesar’s wife, while she was engaged in celebrating the mys·
teries of Bona Dea.

le. Potestas esset erepta .· When the affair of Clodius's polluting the
mysteries of Bona Dea was brought before the senate, it was resolved
to refer it to the colle e of priests, who declared it to be an abominabis
impiety3 upon whicff the consuls were ordered to provide 'a law for
bringing Clodius to trial. But Q. Fusius Calenus, one of the tri-
bunes, supported ογ all the Clodian faction, would not permit the
law to be offered to the suffrages, of the citizens. The affair being
likely to produce great disorders, Hortensius proposed an expedient
which was accepted by both parties, that the tribune Fusius should
publish a law for the trial of Clodius ογ the praetor, with a select
bench of 'udges. The consequence was, that by bribery a majority
οξ Ehe judges were induoed to acquit Clodius, and he thus escaped
wit im unit . ⁸

29. agpid :y Via understood. Cicero here artfully insinuates, that,
though the senate had found the fray upon the Appian Way to -be
an act of treason against the commonwealth, yet that Milo could
never be affected ογ that decree, because, sa s he, it was the vio-
lence, that constituted the treason. Now lodius, the aggressor,
was the author of the violence, and nqt Milo, to whom the principles
of aelf-defence, without an regard to the consequences, gave a
right to preserve his own lifg.

32. Quod si, etc. .- Had not the senate been controlled b the tri-.
bune Munatius Plancus, they would have decreed, that Milo should
be “iad in the usual form, and he probably would have been ac-

uitte . . .

q 36. Divisa sententia.- When any opinion, proposed to the senate,
was thought too neral, and to include several distinct articles, ,
· smne of which mig t be approved, and others rejected, it was usual·
to require that it might be divided. This was the case with the
first decree relative to the death of Clodius ; it contained three dis-

. tinct charges; it declared that the death of Clodius, the burnin of
the court, and the attack upon Lepidus’s house, were acts hosti e tq
the commonwealth. Neither party would agree to this decree en-
tirely; the enemies of Milo therefore obtained a new decree, that
there should bea special trial of the author of Clodius’s death.

36. postulante nescio quo: This was Q. Fusius, a senator, whom
Munatius Plancus had corrupted by bribery. Cicero does not name
him, because he was in the senate.

44. Qudd nisi vidisset, etc„- Cicero well knew of what great au-
thority Pompey's opinion would be iu this-trial. He therefore, with-
