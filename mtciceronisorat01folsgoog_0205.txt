at this time in υ, part of the Forum which was called Comitium, where
the pulpit or tribunarstood, from which the oratore used to hai-angue
then„ it was asterwards called Rostra, because it was adorned with
the beaks of the ships taken from the Antiates. In this place none
spoke, except men of distinction and m ’ trates. A great propor-
fion of the most important business of e republic was here trans·
acted. The orations here delivered were much more polished und
elegant than those pronounced in the courts of the judges. Hence
the epithets amplissimus, ornatissimus. . ·
