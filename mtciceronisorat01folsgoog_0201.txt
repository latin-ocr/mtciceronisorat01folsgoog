THE ‚ORATION FOR THE MANILIAN LAw.

 

INTRODUCTION.

Tms celebrated oration, the first. which Cicero delivered from the
Rostra, was pronounced in the 687th year of Rome, irr the ‹ssst ear
of the orator s age, and three years before the orations against ati·
line. The Romans at that time were engaged in war with Mithri·
dates, ki of Potitus. This monarch, able ambitione, warlike, and
a secondnfiannibal in military talents, as well as in hatred to the Ro-
mans, disdained to submit to the commands of the Roman commis·
sioners in Asia, which checked his enterprises, and, in cool blood,
ordered eiglathousand, Roman citizens to be massacred in one da .
Sulla, and, r him, Lucullus, had been sent against this powe
{15¹3}oe {uffiwffl Ἢζθρὲῖῗιῗέοὲθῖῗῗὲ ὴῖῗεέῑῗξξὲὲῗξιῑὲιῖζὲἒᾷ

peace with Mithridates, an’d give him an opportunity to retrieve his
affairs, and make more vigorous opposition m future. Lucullus prob-
ably would have sub‘ugated him, had not a mutiny in the Roman
army existed, and ha not the general’s persona] enemies in Rome
persuaded the senate to recall him. These unfortunate incidente
enabled Mithridates to become master of the field; the Roman army
was dissipated; the Roman eneral was removed; Glabrio, the con-
sul, who was sent to succee Lucullus, was a man of inferior talents.

At this time, Manilius, one of the tribunes, proposed a law, that -

Pompey, who was then m Cilicia terminating the piratio war, should
have the government of Asia added to his commissum, with the com·

. mand of the Mithridatio war, and of all the Roman armies in those

parts. This law was much opposed by the senate, who were unwill-
ing to confer so extensive authorit upon any individuas, but wa's so
acceptable to the peo le, of whom ompey was a great favorite, that
none but Catulus au Hortensius, who had both passed through the
consulship, dared to s ak against it. It was defended by Servilius
Isauricus and Caesar; icero also, at that time praetor, most eloquent·
ly advocated it in this oration.
