M. ANTONY.

the sixth os August in continuing his voyage ιο Greece, some cir·
cumstances obliged him ιο put back3 and when he reentered the city,
he met some citizens, just arrived from Rome, who brou ht a report,

that a full meeting of the senate was eipccted on the rst of Sep· ”
tember; that Brutus and Cassius had sent circular letters requesting ·

the attendance of all their friends; that Antony was likely to drop
his designs; that, as the cause of the republic had so favorable an
aspect, his own departure wan censui-ed, and his presence earnestly
desired. Though Cicero was not greatly encouraged by these re-
orts, he determined to return to Rome ; and, having arrived on the
ast of August, he found that the expectatione, which he had been
made to entertain of Antony's intentioris, were void of foundation,
and that the out s he was likely to commit were such m to make

it extreme} e for any distinguished friend of the republic to

come into ‘sugilowen For this reason, Cicero, on the first of Sep· ·

tember, sent an excuse to the senate, pleading the ill state of his
health, which obliged him to remain in his own house. Antony
considered his absence from the senate as an affront to himself, or as
giving ιοο much countenance to the suspicions which were enter·

inge froin the sentence of the law. He was dissuaded, however,

from any attempt to execute his threat5 and, being himself absent·

from the senate on the following day, Cicero ventui-ed ιο take his
seat, and, in the absence os the consul, delivered that oration, which
is entitled the First Philippic. In this s eech, he accounted sor his
late retirement from the capital, and for is present return, in term·
stron ly reflecting on the conduct and administration os the present
consu . Antony, in his turn, greatly exasperated by the reports he
received of Cicero’s speech, repared to reply at a subsequent meet·
ing of the senate3 and desivered himself accordingly with great
