the senate, Catiline, who was a pe eet master of the art of dissimu-

spthers not to believe too hastily what had been said ainst him ;
that such was his family, and such had been the tenor o his whole

before he went off, he had a short conference with Lentulus, Cethe·

them earnestly to neglect no means of augmenting· their number,
