makes against the charges os flattery and selfish motives, as that au-
thor offers no other proof of his disinterestedness, than his own dec·
laration in the close of the oration. Mt. Melmoth, the elegant
translator oi' Cicero's letters Ad Familiares, still further weakens his
pretensions to sincerity. He says, ‘⁴ Cicero's real sentiments and

Cicero himself, who, in a future period of his life, confessed he had
.pronounced praises on Pompey‚ which he did not deserve3 and for
the last, we have the authority of Plutarch, who says Lucullus pos-
?essedfgreat qualities‚ courage, vigilance, activity, prudence, and the

Marcelli3 but of Marcus arcellus, Cicero was a particular friend.
Marcellus was no less eminent on account of his birth, than for the
rank he held in the republic; his courage and conduct were equally
conspicuous, and the testimonies of historians unite in characterizing

posed Coesar, and avowed his intentione to rum him. Aster the bat-
