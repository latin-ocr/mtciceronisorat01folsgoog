KJNG nmo-unus. 22⁷

31. Le ntorum pedibus.- Phidippus had been in the service 'of Dei·
phtariusgs iepitrgiles, and perhaps in no more h‘onorable a capacity than

a ο a oo an.

9. Sed tud sapientia fit oeqnissimum: Sufficient has already been
said concerning Cicero’s fiattery of Coesar.

11. Nemo enimsere esc, etc„- This observation is just, and, Cicero
deserves credit for suggesting it to Caesar. When a man is both
jud e and party in an accusation, there is great probability, that he
w' be more favorable to himself than to the accused.

34. Qm' pro multis saepe dixisti .- Ina note to a former oration (page
7⁷, line 4), we have already observed, that Caesar, in the early part of
his life, applied himself to the business of the bar.

38. De accusatorum spe: That the student may be able to judge
more impartially of the character of Deiotarus and his accusers, we
will quote an observation of a judicious commentator. ‘⁴ As to the
facts laid down in this oration, we can say very little 3 but, by what
we understand from our author himself in other parts of his writings,
the charges are not so destitute of probability and proof, as he would
represent them: With regard to the characters, the one given of Dei-
otarus, throughout this oration, 1 am apt to believe, is very much mis·
represented; for, by all other accounts, he appears to have been a
monster of blood and cruelty 3 since he put to death all his own

children, and afterwards Castor’s own father, which may well ac·‚

count for Castor’s appearing in the prosecution.”

19. Si....excusatione aecatis usus esset .· It is related that Caesar told
Deiotarus, ‘⁴ You are a very old man; Pompey is not to expect, that
you are to take the field; therefore 1 beg you will not go in person,
though, if you please, you may send your troops; nay, your son at
their head 3 '² and that Deiotarus was so inveterate an enemy to Cae-
‘thr’ ¹}th he would not urge even old age as an excuse for not taking

e e . .

24. Errare ommuni lapsus est .· Cicero here artfully apologizes for
Deiotarus without offending Cae'sar, by paying the tribute of fiattery,
which ina few lines follows, and by ap earing to believe the plausi·
ble excuses Caesar had formed to justify iiis usurpatione.

2. In quem ciam Dii atque homines, etc. .- Env and emulation cease
‘with the life of the person envied and rivalle . An ambitious man,
therefore, will hear without being offended the praises bestowed upon
a deceased enemy, which, had the enemy been living, would have
induced him to inflict upon the paneg rist the dictates of the severest
vengeance. The encomiums Cicero ere pronounces upon Pompey
were, without doubt, rather pleasing than offensive' to Caesar3 the
more Pompey was extolled‚ the more merit the conqueror of Pom·

pey attributed to himself. Cicero, therefore, who well knew the ef· ·

fect of compliments, deserves here more credit for his knowledge of
mankind, than for the freedom of his praises of Pompey.

23. Alexandrinum bellum .- Afte‘r the battle of Pharsalia, Coesar im·
mediately set sail for Ε ypt, to which country Pompey had fied aster
his defeat. Upon his finding, the first news he received informed
him of Pompey’s miserable end. He wept, when he heard the ac-
count, and shortly after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to
his memory. At this time there· were two pretenders to the crown
of Egypt, Ptolemy, the acknowledged king, and the celebratedaCle-
opatra, his sister. Caesar ordered both of them to rnaintain their
pretensions before him. Photinus, the young king’s guardian, dis-
dained accepting this proposal‚ and sent an army of twenty thou·
