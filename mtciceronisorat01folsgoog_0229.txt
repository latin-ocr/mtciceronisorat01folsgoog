THE· ORATION FOR KIN G DEIQTARUS.

 

INTRODUCTION.

· Or the facts relative ιο this oration, we can leam but little from his-
torians3 even the character os Deiotarus seems not to be ascertained ’ ·
with accuracy3 he is represented by some as amiable and virtuous,
by others as sanguinary and cruel. An incident, which has perhaps
prevented the facts concerning the subject of this oration from being
more fully and correctly known, is, that it was not delivered in the
Forum, but privately before Caesar in a dwelling-house. What. we
are able to learn is, that king Deiotarus was Tetrarch of Gallograejcia3
that, during the civil wars between Coesar and Pompey, he asaisted
the latter; that, aster the battle of Pharsalia, he abandoned his party; Α
that, after having been stripped of art of his dominionS‚ to atone
for his offence, he was pardoned by aesar3 that, during the wars in
the East, he entertained Coesar as his guest 111 the castle of Luceiusz
