7., Forum.- The Forum was a large oblon space between the Cap· 35
itoline and Palatine hills, where ‘the assem lies of the people were
held, where justice was administered, and public business transacted.
Cicero had frequently been in danger in the Forum from the designa
of Catilina—Campus .· The Campus Martius was a large plain along
the Tiber, consecrated to Mars. On this plain the Cmnitia Centuri-
ata were held for creating consuls, proetors, censors, and other magis-
tcrates3 anal inh this place also Catiline several times attempted to put

icero to ea .

the life of Cicero.

these magistrates sat in the senate-house, the Rostra, or tribunal of
justice, was called sella curulis.

15. Hunc exitum consulatus.- Cicero is supposed to have delivered
this oration on the 5th of December, and, as Decius Junius Silanus,
and Lucius Licinius Muraena, the consuls elect, were to enter upon
their office on the first of January, his consulship would soon expire.

he, however, tells them to cease their concern for him, and be re·
gardful only of the public interest.

31. Turpis. ..immaturo ..... misera.- A brave man would never die
basely—a consular man could never die immaturely; when he at·
tained consular dignity, he attained the hi hest pitch of political
clevation-a wise man would not die miserabfy ; it was a doctrine of
the philosophy of the Stoics, that he would not be unhappy in the
most excruciating torments.
