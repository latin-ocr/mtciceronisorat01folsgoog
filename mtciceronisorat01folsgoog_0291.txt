Tms new work has been prepared expressly to meet the growing demand
for an easy algebraic course, in consequence of the improved condition of
SchooIS, at the present time, enabling pupils to complete ‚their arithmetical
, studies at a comparatively early age. This book excels others of the
kind :- · '

1. In the clearness and degn-lnce qf'tlie definitione and statements qurinciffloe.

2. In the purely Aiunt-no nn'mon parented, and the strictly nomeu, develop-
ment qs tlte science.

⁶3. In includinq Am. THE IMPROVEMERTS required by tlte best standan-ds qs
instruction. ⁹

4. In containinq articles on the stcnssmn or Pnonmns, Rulorumzn·
mox, Rimcu, EQuAuons, and the Tnssomr or Quantum Eoum-mnu
thus adaptinq the work to the range qf classes in Academies as well as in Public
Schools. ⁰ ⁸ ”

*21:¹¹¹ GREENLEAF'S NEW ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA is a ηπ
wonx, and not a nausson of his “ Tnmmsnl’ The latter continues to be
printed for schools requiring such a book. The two Algebras are quite dif-
ferent3 both, however, being well adaptet] to the class of pupils for which
they are designed.

The Nuw Eanum-int Amnum may generally be entered upon by pupils
who have mastered the suthon-’s Commu Scuoot, Amnum-10, or any

similar book. It is easy and progressive, yet sufficiently comprehensive to meet
the requirements of Common Schools and Academies.

No labor or expense has been spared 'to make this work the anr of its kind

Ι ever published in uby country.
