he has been induce to support ‚the Manilian law only by the dis-
interested motives of patr-intrem, many modern authors will not be·
lieve him. We will quote the remarks of these critics, premising that
the eloquence of Cicero contributed to the enantion of the law. The
elegant writer os the ‘⁴ observatione on the Life an‚d Writings of ci-
cero ” speaking of Cicero and thooe who spoke in favor of the Manil-
isn aw, says, “ Tbey had not the least pretence of public necessity
to justify it. ...But Lucullus, who commanded in Asia, had overcome
Mithridates in several battles, and was as capable of finishin the
war, as he was, whom they appointed to be his successor‘. Wi an
eloquence worthy of a better cause, he [Cicero] most artfiilly re-
flected on Lucullus, whose reputation as well as authority was ιο be
made a sacrifice ιο the envy of Pompe ; then he proceeded to des·
cant upon Pompey's character, whic he set off with all the orna-
ments of rhetoric5 attributing tohim the whole success, not only of
the African, Spanish and piratic wars, but even of that against the -
slaves, the honor of which was solely due ιο Crassus. Thus, by
cruelly in'uring two of the greatest generals that were in the coms
monweal ‚ by a most servile fiattery of the man who was manifestly
overturni all its liber-ties, he brought the people ιο consent ιο the
Manilian aw; which, had a regard ιο the interest of his country
been. his constant rinciple, he ought to have opposed as violently
as he aflerwards didp the A ian law, or any other attempt against
the safety and freedom ο the state.'’ Monsieur Crevier, the con·
tinuator of Rollin’s Roman‘ history, speaking of the Manilian law,
says, ‘⁴ We have the discourse which Cicero pronounced on this oc-
casion. lt is more to his honor as an orator, than as a patriot, or a
commonwealth‘s man. ....But he had the consulship nearly in view,
and it behoved him therefore to gain the ople’s favor, and make
sure of the friendshi of Pompey. The earned author of ‘⁴ The
Divine Legation of NflisesJ’ etc., while considering the character of
Cicero, sa s, in the third section of the third book, ‘⁴ The several and
various c ters he sustained in his life and wrifings, habituated
him to feign and dissemble his opinions. He may be considered as
an orator, a statesman, a philosopher, characters all equally person·
ated; and no one more the real man than the other, but each of them
taken up and laid down for the occasion. This appears from the
numerous inconsistencies found in him throughout the course of his
sustaining them.’' Having mentioned an instance in which the
philosopher confuted the statesmam the author adds, ‘⁴ as in another
instance the‘statesman seems to have got the better of the hilosopher.
He defends the paradoxes of the Stoics in a philosophie issertatiom ·
but, in his oration sor Murena, he ridicules those paradoxes in the
freest manner. ....Nor under one and the same character, or at one
and the same time, is he more consistent. ....In a word, he laughed
at the opinions of state, when he was amongst philosophers; he
hughed at the doctrines os the philosophers, when he was cajoling
