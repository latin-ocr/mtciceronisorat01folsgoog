⁸ ιω THE SECOND ORATION

21 38. An tabulas novas ,9 By the laws of the Twelve Tables, it was
ordered, that insolvent debtors should be given up to their creditor:
to be bound in fetters and cords; and, although they did not entirely
lose the rights of fieemen, yet they were-in actual slavery, and oflen ·
treated more hmhly than even slaves themselves. To check thu.
cruelty of -usurers, a law was asterwsrds made, by which it was pro-
vided, that no debtor should be kept in irons or in bonds3 that the
goods of the debtor, not his person, should be given up to his cred-
ιιοη. Βιιι the people, not sntisfied with this, as it did not free them
from prison, osten nsterwards demanded an entire abolition of debts
which they used to call Now Tables. But this was never ted
them. At one time, however, by ο, law passed by Valerius iliacam,
silver was pald with brues, that is, the fourth part of a debt onl was
