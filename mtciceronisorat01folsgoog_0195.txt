placed clemency under the mande of r' id justice. He said, if the
prisonem desei-ved the most severe punis ment, ts it was observed,
e dissented from the opinion which had been sdvsnced. Death, he
thought, was not designed by the immorml gods as a punishment,
but either as a necessary law os nature, or a cessation of toils and
misery3 it was his opinion, thaz bomanel perpetual imp-isonment
were omnrived for the punishment of tho mont detestable crimes ς and
he therefore advised, that the estates of the criminals should be oon-
fiscated, that their persons should be closely ·confined in the strongest
os the municipal towns, und that it should be unlawful for any one
hereafler to move the senate or peo le in their favor. His speech

altered his opinion, and that the friends of Cicero, solicitous for his
safety, which they thought would be secured by mild mensures,

the opinions of the senators to be changing, is supposed to have risen,
and delivered the following oration, the tendeney of which, although
it hod the semblanoe of neutrality, stro ly supported the counsel of
Silanus. lt is, however, the opinion o some, that this oration was
never spoken, but that it contains man interna] robable proofs of
its bein , not an extemporary *speec , but a. ln ored composition,
made at isure, many years aster the debate.
