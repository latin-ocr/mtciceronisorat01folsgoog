Τ. A. MILO. - 245

411115, From his hopes of impunity.

And the evidence, upon which these circumstances are alleged,
are the words and actions of the deceased.

The conclusion of the whole is, Milo acted on sels-defence, and
Clodius was lawsully killed.

hul? Novi judicii nova forma .- This is called a new trial, because Pfffis
Milo was not tried by the proetor, as was usual in criminal cases,

but by a special commission and an extraordinary judge. By nova
forma he refers to the strong guard, which Pompey brought to the

trial, in order to prevent any violence.

12. Cn. Pompeii, sapientissimi et justissimi viri .- Though Pompey

was not dissatisfied with Clodius's death, or the manner of it, but

leased, rather, that the republic was freed at any rate from so pesti--
lent a demagogue, et he resolved to take the benefit of the occasion
for getting nd of ilo too, froin whose ambition and high spirit he
had reason to apprehend no less trouble. Cicero, bein sensible of
this, as well as the great authority and influence of fiompey, en-
deavors, through the whole of this oration, to remove the effects
which they might have upon the minds of the judges.

21. Rplz'qua, etc. .· At this trial there were present three ranks of
men3 the soldiers, whom Pompey had placed there ; the citizens, who
waited the event of the trial ; and the Clodians, who exerted them·
selves to procure the condemnation of Milo. The last mentioned con-
sisted of profii ate, low, and abandoned wretches, whom Clodius, by
his rapines, ha gained over to his interest.

29. Hesterna....ccmcione.· The day before Cicero pleaded for Milo,
the tribune Munatius Plancus called the people together, and ex-
horted them to appear the next day in a full body, when ljudgrnent
was to be 'ven, and to declare their sentiments in so pub ic a man-
ner, that t e accused might not be suffered to escape; which Cicero
reflects upon as an insult upon the liberty of the bench.

1. Quid enim nubis duobus, etc. .- Cicero here excites the compassion 101
of the judges in his own and Milo's favor, froma consideration of the
services they had done the state, and the injuries they had received
from the Clodians. Milo might justly claim the hi hest offices, on
account of his merit; and accordingly had been ormerly created
tribune, and now stood for the consulship.

12. Τ. Annii nihuriatu, etc. .- Milo was a tribune the ‘year aster
Clodius filled that office, and, durin his tribuneship, he checked the
·seditions of Clodius, and exerted imself to procure the recall of
Cicero from exile.

14. Insidias Miloni a Clodio factas .- The great point which
Cicero wishes to prove, is, that Clodius. waylaid Milo ; but while he
demonstrates this, he frequently insinuates, that, if Milo had pre-
meditated the death of Clodius, he would have deserved honors rather
than punishment, sor destroyin so desperate and dangerous an ene-
milon) ἓεεῖζῖφῖῗῗθῧέἓ glgdiir'nzfassgintgd, that Milo deserved death for
having killed a man. This assertion Cicero refutes by an argument
derived from the examples of former ages of the republic, and from
decisione to the contrat in parallel cases. · '

- 33. M. Horatii .· In t e 83rd year of Rome, when Tullus Hostilius
was king, there was a war between the Romans and the Albans.
Aster some success on both sides, and-when the two armies were near
each other, the Alban general discovered, that some of the neighbor-
