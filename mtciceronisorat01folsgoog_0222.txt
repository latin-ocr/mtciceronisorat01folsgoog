216 THE ORATION Fon

64 says Dr. Middleton, “ that 118 was delivering a speech of thanks, 80
only sor himself, but in the 88818 and at the request of the senate,
where his subject naturally required the embellishments of oratory3
8811 that 811 1118 compliments are grounded on 8 supposition, that
Caesar intended to restore the republic; os which he entertained no

to a conqueror, in the height of all his power, should want to be
tempered with some few strokes of flattery.” Os this defence every
088 will form his own opinion.

33. Gratulationibss: In his Commentarios, Coesar informs us, that
twenty-five days os congratulation were decreed to him for his suc·
88888818 Gaul, and we 818 told by Dio, that after his civil wars forty
days more were for like purposes decreed to him. But the day here
spoken os, says Guthrie, 1188 ιο 118 referred to any of these ; because
08 it he had extended mercy an forgiveness, which are personal
virtues, and cannot, like the glories of war, be shared by others.

⁴2. Victores bellorum civilium.- The victoroes of Sulla, Marius, Oc·
tarius and Cinna, were succeeded by sanguinar vengeance.

65 20. Repudiari .· In a note upon thus passage, 81081118 says, Caesar
was (1118110118 of peace, Cicero advised it, and Pom y rejected it.
It may 118 8 fact that Caesar desired ace, but he esired only the
peace of slavery, the non-resistance 0 tame submission to his im·
perious mandates5 and, although the general conduct of Pompey
demonstrated that 118 1188 neither a great politician nor an able gen-
eral, yet, with manly indignation, 118 rejected peace, 88 8 republican
should have done, upon such 11888 conditione. .

sentence assigna for the whole reason of his Joining Pompey what
was only one of his inducements. He really thou ht that Caesar

olitical principle, united himself to the Pompeian party. 1’3ut he
gere tells caesar, that he sided with Pompey from private, not public
motives, bound by ties of gratitude for the personal favore he had
received from him, and that, cool, and conscious of his danger, he

lunged, as it were, into voluntary destruction. This apology might
have been successful; but. it is tobe regretted‚ that talenta so great
as those of Cicero confessedly were, should be employed in 8 service
so dishonorable 88 that of flattery and dissimulation.

30. Cum capitis mei periculo .· The following comment has been
made upon these words. Cicero 1188 not present at the battle of
Pharsalm, nor 1188 Cato, who ataid behind also in the ‚camp at
Dyrrachium, which he commanded with fifteen cohorts, when Labi·
enus brought them the news of Pompey's defeat; upon which Cato
offered the command to Cicero, as the superior in dignity ; and, upon
his refusal of it, as Plutarch tells us, young Pompey was so enraged,
that 118 drew his sword. and would have killed him upon the spot, if
Cato had not prevented it. Though this fact is not mentioned hy

Cicero, yet it is probable he refers to it in this passage.

tulus, L. Domitius AEnobarbus, and Curius. The compliments paid
to Caesar's clemency were in part deser-ved, as it is probable'‚ that, if
