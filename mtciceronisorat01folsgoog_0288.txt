*ᾖ* Gannumr's INTELLECTUAL Am'rmmnc is a new work, and not
GREENLEAF'S [oLD] Pmmmr Amrmmzmo with only the title changed, as
has been represented by parties interested in the circulation of competing works.
The [old] Primary Arithmetic continues to be printed for schools requiring
· such a book. The two Axithmeties should not be confounded, as the design of
’ each is quite different. Both are well adapted to the class of pupils for which
they are designed.

szmxmAr' s INTELLECTUAL Amnum-mo should be used after the an

Panum( Amnum-10 in cities and towns where the schools are properly
graded.
