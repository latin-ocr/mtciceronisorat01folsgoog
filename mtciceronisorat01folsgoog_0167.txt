INTRODUCTION.

Locrus Sanetus Car-mn, of an illustrious famil from which
consuls and military tribunes with consular power , uentl
been taken to govern the state), was a man of singular stren 31 both
of body and mind, but of a disposition extremely vicinus. e had a
head to contrive, a tongue to rsuade‚ and a hand to execute the har· '
diest attempt From his you n ‚ he took pleasure in civil broils,civil,
wars, rapine, and massacres. e was wonderfully constituted ,for

For his polluted soul, full of rage against both gods and men, could find
no rest either waiting or sleeping, so incessantly did a guilty con·
science torment him.' Hence his sace was pale, his countenance
ghastly‚ his gait and motion une-qual, now uick, then slow; in a
word, his appearance was that of a man out o his senses.

He had probabi been quoestor in the year 676, or 677, and, after

the expiration o his quaestorship, lientenant to Scribonius Curi0, -

proconsul of Macedon, Anno Urbis 6⁷83 and he was prator at Rome
