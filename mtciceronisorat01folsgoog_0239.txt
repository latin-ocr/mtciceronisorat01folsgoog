lected a large libr-ary, which was open to all men of learning.

7. Praeteaetatus: e toga precata was given to young men about

. ‘the sixteenth year of their age. It is probable, that Archias was rathe

farther advanced in life when he went to Rome. ·

12. Q. Metello....Numidico .- This Metellus was surnamed Numidi·
cas, because he defeated Jugurtha in two battles, and laid waste all
Numidia. According to Plutarch, he was an uncle of the Luculli.—
Ejus Pio-filio .· The son of Metellus was called Pius, because by his
entreaties he obtained his father’s recall from exile. The old Roman
signification of pietas was fitial duty ; theolo 'cal writers use it in the
sense of duty towards God, our heavenly Fa er.

13. M. AEmilio: AEmilius Scaurus was at the head of the senate,
and a man of great influence.——Q. catulo .· There were an orator and

Marcus Cato, was a tribune of the people‚ and was slain at home in
the beginning of the social war. There were three Octavii in Rome ;
Cneius, who was consul with Cinna see Note, page 32, line 39) 3
another Cneius of a different family, w ο was colleague of Curio in
the consulship3 and Lucius, who was consul in conjunction with

Asia, when praetor, had the province of Sicily, and when consul, ob·
tained Asia again. Archias attended him in these provinces.

22. Heracleam: Heraclea was an Italian city, situated upon the
borders of Campania, near Rhegium an'd Tarentum. It was one of
the associate cities, whose citizens had the same privile s that the
Romans had. Archias of course, therefore, might claim 1.ξὲ privileges
of a Roman citizen.

23. Foedere .· The alliance was made with Heraclea, at the time king
Pyrrhus was in Italy, in the year of Rome 475. ,

34. Dicta .- “ Defended.'' ‘

43. Italico bello: In the 662nd year of Rome, the Italian allies of
the Romans made war upon the republic, to obtain the freedom of the
city by arms. This occasioned the Italic or social war, which has
also been called the Marsic war, because it was begun by the Marsi.

.4· Religionem .- Testimony was thought religious, because it was 93
guig? ἳίξοῖαἶῖὶὲὲι Archias did not record his name in those registers
which were kept negligently, but in those kept by Metellus, a man
of unquestionable integrity.

Archias was registered. The register of Appius was known to be
kept negligently ; and the corruption of Gabinius, while he was safe,
