About the beginning of June (689), in the consulship of L. Caesar,
and C. vaulus, Catiline began to n his project to his confidants3
to each o thern at first alone ; and ving sounded them sufficiently,
so as to rceive their several tempers and dispositione he called to·
gether a those who were the most distressed in their afl‘airs, and the
most desperately b01d3 ljustiging it now advisable to speak to them in
a body. In this assemb y, there were of senator-ian rank, P. Cornelius ,
Lentulus Sura, P. Autronius, L. Cassius Longinus, C. Cethegus, P.
Sulla and S. Sulla (the sons of Servius Sulla), L. Vargunteius, Q.
AnniussM. Porcius Iaaeca, L. Bestia, and Q, Curius; os the eques·

⁷and C. Cornelius.

lentissus was descended from a patrician branch of the Cornelian
family, one of the most numerous, as well as the most splendid in
Rome. His grandfather had borne the title of “ Prince of the Senate,”
and was the-most active in the pur-suit and destruction of C. Grac-
chus, in which he received a dangerous wound. 'l'he grandson, by the
favor os his noble birth, had been advanced to the consulship about
eight years before, but was turned out of the senate soon aster by the
censors, sor the notorious infamy of his life, till, by obtaining the prae·
torship a second time, which he now actually enjoyed, he recovered
bis former place and rank in that supreme councrl. His parts were
but moderate, or rather slow3 et the comeliness of his person, the
gracefulness and propriety of his · action, the strength and sweet·
uess of his voice, procured him some reputation as a speaker. He
was hzy, luxurious, and profligately wicked ; yet so vain and ambi-
tious, as to expect, from the overthrow of the government, to be the
first man in the aeepublic5 in which fancy. he was strongly flattered
by some crasty soothsayers, who assured him, from the Sibyllino
books, that there were three Cornelius’s 'destined to.the dominion ‘of

ecution, and hoping to reap the chre fruit from its success.

Cethegus, of an extraction equally noble (being of the Cornelian
family), was of a temper fierce, impetuous, and dar-ing, to a degree
even of fury. He had been warml engaged in the cause of Marius,
with whom he was driven out Rome3 but when Sulh's affairs
became prosper-ons, he presently changed. sides, and throwing him-
self at Sulla’s feet, and promising great services, was restored to the
city. Aster Sulla's death, by intrigues and facti'tm, he acquired so
great an influenoe, that, while Pompey was abroad, he governed all

of t Mediterranean, and for Lucullus the mana ement of the ·
Mithridatic war. In the height o‘f this power, he ma e an excursion
into Spain, to raise contributions in that province, where, meeting

avith some opposition to his violences, he had the hardiness to insult,
and even wound the proconsul Q. Metellus Pius. But the insolence of
his conduct, and the infamy of his life, gradual diminished, and at
