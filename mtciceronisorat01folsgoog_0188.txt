an cath from Lentulus Cethegus, Statilius, and Cassius, under their
hands and seals, to show to their constituente, who, without such
credentials, would never be induced to enter into an engagement so
hazardous. Not suspecti any fraud, all complied, except Cassius
who promised he wouldnge in their country in a very short time.
Vulturcius was appointed to introduce them to Catiline in their road,
and Lentulus at the same time sent a particular letter to Catiline,
under his own hand and seal, though without his name. . Cicero,
being informed of all the roceedings of this meeting‚ engaged the
deputies to be upon the ulvian bridge at a certain tinie of night
with Vulturcius their letters and papers, and told them that L.
Flaccus and C. f’omptinus, two of the praetors, whom he had ordered
to lie in arnbush near the place with a strong guard of friends and
soldiers, would there arrest them, and bring them ιο him. His direc-

him. The consul, being informed also of a quantity of arms provided
by Cethegus for the use of the conspiracy, ordered C. Sulpicius,
another o the praetors, to search his house, where he found a great
number of swords and daggers‚ with other arms, newly cleaned, and
ready for present service. Cicero then assembled the senate in the
tem le of Concord‚ carried thither the deputies and conspiratura, re-
laed, all he had discovered and done, examined the several parties,
and made a complete discovery of the whole plot. The senate then,
the witnesses and criminals being withdrawn, went into debate upon
the state of the republic, and resolved‚ that public thanks should be
decreed to Cicero, who had delivered the republic from the atest
dan rs; that thanks should also⁰be given to the praetors, laccus
and omptinus, for their faithful execution of Cicero's orders; that
⁸ the conspirators, who were taken, and others, who should afterwards
be arrested, should be kept in safe custody; and that a public thanks-

thereupon in the following speech.
